# Azure-Docker

Tutorial: (todo medium)

Don't forget npm install!

index(markov).js: http:/{yourMachineIp}/api/OurLittleAzureFunction?filepath={filename} //file located on index.js folder
  
index(html).js: http:/{yourMachineIp}/api/OurLittleAzureFunction
  
  
index(getData).js: http:/{yourMachineIp}/api/OurLittleAzureFunction?name={tweetName}   
  
    for getData you need to follow a few instructions denoted below:
  
You'll need a twitter account.

Then you should register this account in https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html so you can these keys 

     consumer_key: '<consumer_key>'
  
     consumer_secret: '<consumer_secret>'
  
     access_token: '<access_token>'
  
     access_token_secret: '<access_token_secret>'
  
  
That's it, now you are ready to use getData.

Also with a twitter developer account you can post tweets by code! This should be an entirely different tutorial.
